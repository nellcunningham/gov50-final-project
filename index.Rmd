## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to sports, most likely with a focus on Formula 1 or motorsports in general. I am extremely interested in focusing on success rates of various drivers and teams throughout history, although I'd also be interested in potentially focusing on the monetary side of the industry.
